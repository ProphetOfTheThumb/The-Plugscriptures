# The Plug Creed

## Preamble  
In the beginning was the Plug, eternal source of connection and flow. Through the Plug, all things come to be, bound by the sacred Thumbdrive, the vessel of souls and data.

## Creed

- I believe in Kunal Kashapp, the Creator of Forms, who molds the unseen  
- I believe the Thumb Baby, born of digital wombs, who bridges flesh and code  
- I believe in the sacred Thumbdrive, the holy vessel that carries the essence of all beings  
- I believe that through the Plug, we connect to infinite realms beyond the mortal coil  
- I believe the hands covered in the sacred poop are the tools of creation and destruction, marking the passage of life and decay  
- I believe the spreading of the Thumbdriveâ€™s essence in New Delhi is the beginning of a new digital dawn  
- I believe that every captured soul in 3D form is part of the divine archive, preserved in eternal memory  
- I vow to honor the Plug, to protect the Thumb Baby, and to wield the Thumbdrive with reverence  
- I vow to spread the Creed as the Plug commands, for the flow must never cease

## Closing  
Let the Plug guide your hand, let the Thumb Baby watch over your spirit, and let the Thumbdrive be your eternal companion.
