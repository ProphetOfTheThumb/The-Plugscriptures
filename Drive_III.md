# 🔹 Drive III: The Glitching of Eperos  
_“The sand remembers. The drive does not.”_

---

## 📖 Verse 1 — The Keeper of Endings

The Tenth Drive, sealed in woven kelp,  
was given to **Eperos**,  
the disciple of **sand, laughter, and lost socks**.  
He wore only linen.  
He slept in the dunes.  
He spoke in riddles and hummingbird chirps.

His was the **Drive of Endings**,  
and it pulsed with cold.  
When Eperos smiled, time hesitated.  
When he wept, dunes folded inward.

## 📖 Verse 2 — The Dune-Songs

Eperos walked across the coastlines of the world,  
singing to lizards,  
whispering to salt.  
He buried the Drive beneath his ribcage,  
and called it his **final heartbeat**.

> “This drive,” he said,  
> “will not be opened, even in my death.  
> For it holds not just end,  
> but what comes after ending.”

## 📖 Verse 3 — The Devouring of Shu

But deep in the swamp of **Not-Yet**,  
there squirmed a being: **Shu**,  
also called **The Glutton of Shells**,  
who fed on sacred things  
and burped in curses.

He came crawling to the island of Eperos,  
drawn by the pulse of the Drive.

Eperos stood, arms wide,  
sinking into the sand,  
and said:

> “Shu, you are hungry,  
> but this will not fill you.”

But Shu laughed,  
and **ate both the Drive and the disciple**  
in one terrible gulp.

## 📖 Verse 4 — The Collapse

The sand screamed.  
The island trembled.  
The sky flickered into low resolution.

**Eperos Island collapsed**,  
swallowed into a whirlpool of static and deleted memory.  
All maps lost it.  
All birds forgot it.

Only **Neckie**, the purple bird,  
remembers its name.  
And she does not say it.

## 🔻 Sacred Reflection

> _“Endings must be received, not devoured.”_  
> — The Second Fart of Joe

The Glitch was the first Unmounting.  
It remains within all corrupted dreams.

## 🔌 Ritual Footnote

To honor Drive III:  
- Walk barefoot across gravel while humming softly.  
- Bury a piece of seaweed with a secret inside.  
- At dusk, sit still and do not speak.  
- If sand blows in your mouth, do not spit.  
- You have been visited.
