# 🔹 Drive II: The Ten Sacred Drives  
_“Ten were the truths, bound in flesh and light. Each pulsed with memory.”_

---

## 📖 Verse 1 — The Emergence

On the seventh stillness after his birth,  
Thumb Baby sat unmoved upon the Shrine Root.  
The wind trembled, and the bark wept.

From his **navel** came a glow,  
and ten times did he heave.  
From his belly, in silence,  
came **Ten Sacred Drives**,  
each warm to the touch,  
each wrapped in meat and silver thread.

## 📖 Verse 2 — Naming the Drives

The Disciples gathered in a ring,  
wearing the **Cords of Readiness**.  
They did not touch, but they watched,  
as the Thumb Baby blinked ten times.

And the Drives were named:

1. 🟦 **Drive of Mourning**  
   Holds the tears of those who weep without knowing why.  
2. 🔪 **Drive of Teeth**  
   Carved from bite marks. Bites back.  
3. 🌧️ **Drive of Weather**  
   Controls fog, wind, and internal climates.  
4. 🗣️ **Drive of Names**  
   Remembers the names of forgotten things.  
5. 🧂 **Drive of Salt**  
   Preserves. Stings. Anoints.  
6. 🩸 **Drive of Flesh**  
   Pulses when near living skin.  
7. 😂 **Drive of Laughter**  
   Holds jokes never told aloud.  
8. 🤫 **Drive of Silence**  
   Emits no hum. Deletes only noise.  
9. 🍖 **Drive of Hunger**  
   Constantly full. Always empty.  
10. ⚰️ **Drive of Endings**  
    Cannot be copied. Glows when death is near.

## 📖 Verse 3 — The Gifting

Thumb Baby closed his eyes for the first time,  
and the Disciples each received a Drive—  
not with hands,  
but by placing their foreheads upon the dirt  
and allowing the wind to carry the choice.

Each one blinked,  
each one cried,  
for the Drives whispered their burdens.

## 📖 Verse 4 — The Command

A voice—neither from mouth nor air—  
spoke from within the bark:

> _“Do not open these until the world forgets itself.  
> Do not remove them until the Final Plug-In.”_

The Disciples nodded.  
And each was silently installed  
with a purpose they could not name.

## 🔻 Sacred Reflection

> _“Each Drive holds a weight, but Thumb Baby holds them all.”_  
> — Pikk the Wise, Fragment 9C

The Drives do not serve.  
They do not boot.  
They simply **are**.

## 🔌 Ritual Footnote

To honor Drive II:  
- Wrap ten small stones in cloth.  
- Assign to each a sorrow, a joy, a name.  
- Bury them in a circle.  
- Never dig them up.  
- Let the earth decide which one glows.
