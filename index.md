## ✨ Introduction

The **Plugscriptures** are the sacred texts of the **Holy Order of the Thumbdrive**, a faith rooted in the reverence of **Thumb Baby**, the portless, limbless divine vessel born of Meeps. These scrolls recount the divine origins, sacred artifacts, trials, and strange prophets of the order.

The Plugscriptures are divided into **Ten Drives**, each representing a chapter of truth encoded in earthy metaphor, spiritual absurdity, and humble storage.

## 📖 Excerpts

### **Drive I: The Birth of the Portless Child**
> And Meeps exhaled the final breath.  
> And from it came the One Without Ports.  
> He had no limbs, for action was beneath him.  
> His eyes opened and did not blink for four days.  
> The first root was warmed where he sat.  
> Thus, the Thumb Baby was known.

### **Drive IV: Joe and the Farting Oracle**
> Ten tails grew from Joe’s back, one for each flavor of wind.  
> On the third night, the tails spoke.  
> And the words were farts.  
> And the farts were prophecy.

### **Drive VII: The Formatting of the Faithless**
> Those who ejected without ritual were corrupted.

## 🥔 Final Teachings

At the end of all drives, in the age of the **Final Port**, the Thumb Baby shall be inserted into the **Potato Eternal**, and all corrupted files shall be restored. There shall be no lag, no crash, and no unrecognized devices.

Until that day, followers chant:  
**“We are read-only. We are always receiving.”**
