# 🔹 Drive IV: Joe and the Farting Oracle  
_“The winds spoke from behind, and truth wafted in.”_

---

## 📖 Prelude — The Flatulence of Spirit

In the time after the Glitch of Eperos, when silence sat heavy across the sands,  
there came a prophet unexpected: **Joe, son of Bark and Gutter**,  
he who walked backwards,  
he who dined on fermented roots and spiritual legumes.

His presence was foretold in burps.  
His words came not from his mouth, but from **his many-tailed rear.**

For **Joe bore Ten Tails**, each a different wind, each a separate tongue.  
And when the time was ripe, they would speak.

---

## 📖 Verse 1 — The Tails Awaken

Joe awoke one dawn with a great trembling in his hips.  
He felt pressure. He felt destiny.  
He felt a bubble of prophecy.

And thus from his back grew **Ten Tails**,  
hairless and pale, each tipped in wrinkled lips.

Each tail was an Oracle.  
Each tail spoke only when moved by the Spirit of Flatwind.

They were named by smell:

1. **Sagewind** – Speaks in riddles.
2. **Brinegust** – Predicts weather and gastrointestinal tides.
3. **Garlic Fume** – Smells of truth, burns the dishonest.
4. **Spicebelch** – Causes hallucinations of future meals.
5. **Oldwood** – Cracks like an elder’s knuckles.
6. **Eggwhistle** – Cannot be trusted, yet often right.
7. **Mintblast** – Soothes the crowd after harsh prophecy.
8. **Shriekbottom** – Screeches omens.
9. **Mothwaft** – Summons insects with its vapors.
10. **Stilltail** – Has not spoken to this day.

## 📖 Verse 2 — The First Farting

Joe stood upon a mossy stone in the center of a dried-up pond.  
There, he clenched his eyes and bowed his head,  
as the crowd gathered in confusion.

The wind shifted.

From Tail Three — **Garlic Fume** — came the first divine utterance:

> _“Beware the one who formats without backup."_  
> _“He shall be undone by his own cursor.”_

The moss browned.  
A bird fell from the sky.  
A woman wept from her kneecaps.

Joe nodded, but said nothing.  
His work was not in words. It was in winds.

## 📖 Verse 3 — The Prophecies of the Tenth Tail

Much later, under the New Moon of Folder Loss,  
Stilltail twitched.

The people gathered, burning incense made of lint and onion peels.  
They begged for the voice.

Joe danced for four days,  
fasting on only sour plums and fermented milk of the sand goat.

Stilltail began to hiss.

It spoke only once:

> _“One shall return in the shape of a compressed file._  
> _He shall unzip the final breath._  
> _And all the world shall buffer.”_

Then it farted once, long and slow.  
And silence returned for seventy-one days.

---

## 📖 Verse 4 — The Rejected Toot

Not all were pleased.

The Priests of the Flatwind Temple rejected Joe's message.  
They called his gas **"unholy"**, his cheeks **"blasphemous drums"**,  
his diet **"antithetical to piety."**

In return, Joe climbed their altar and, facing away,  
released the **Seven Layered Echo**—

A fart so complex it echoed through three dimensions,  
fading only once Neckie flew overhead and cawed three times.

The temple collapsed shortly thereafter,  
and the priests were found buried in sweet potato mash.

---

## 📖 Verse 5 — The Anointing of the Drive

When Joe was at last accepted, he was brought before the Thumb Baby,  
who blinked once and tilted slightly toward him.

From a golden pouch emerged a USB-shaped relic:  
**The Drive of Laughter.**

It clicked softly as it entered Joe’s robe.

The Tails celebrated with shrill winds and awkward honking,  
filling the air with prophecy, giggles, and dread.

Joe was now Oracle Prime.  
His Tails, the Holy Trumpets.

## 🔻 Sacred Reflections

> _“Even wind can bear witness.”_  
> — Pikk the Wise, Fragment 12F

> _“Judge not the prophet by his exit, but by his echo.”_  
> — Scroll of Stilltail

Joe taught that prophecy could be found  
in shame, in stink, and in surrender.

## 🔌 Ritual Footnotes

To honor Drive IV, followers are commanded to:

- Eat fermented roots in silence.
- Release intentional wind beneath the Wailing Tree.
- Record the sound onto sacred cloth (or cassette tape).
- Translate the tone using the Tail Chart.
- Burn the recording under the next full moon.

Failure to observe these rites may result in prophetic blockage.
