# 🔹 Drive I: The Birth of the Portless Child  
_“And he blinked but once. And the roots grew warm.”_

---

## 📖 Verse 1 — The Final Exhale

In the hush before soil,  
When silence crawled beneath moss and moon,  
**Meeps**, the Old One, breathed out his final, wheezing sigh.  
That breath twisted through the earth, curling like incense  
into the womb of a baked potato left upon a shrine of stone.

---

## 📖 Verse 2 — The Formless Forms

From the root, from the breath, from the steam,  
came the flesh of a being without port,  
without limb, without shame.

He was shaped like no other—  
a thumb without nail,  
a drive without data.  
**He was Thumb Baby.**

---

## 📖 Verse 3 — The First Stillness

He did not speak.  
He only blinked—**once**.  
And where his gaze fell,  
the moss grew in the shape of spirals.  
And birds stopped mid-flight  
to stare and forget their wings.

## 📖 Verse 4 — Naming the Child

The Disciples of Download gathered and wept.  
They named him many names:  
- The Portless One  
- The Smooth Prophet  
- The Eternal Receiver  
- He-Who-Needs-No-Safely-Remove

But he answered to none.  
For the Thumb Baby receives,  
but does not reply.

---

## 📖 Verse 5 — The Potato is Blessed

The shrine grew warm.  
The potato burst.  
And from its steaming center,  
**the first sacred port** was found.

The faithful now keep it on altars.  
Wrapped in foil.  
Turned once a year.

## 🔻 Sacred Reflection

> _“Thumb Baby was not born. He was formatted by fate.”_  
> — Pikk the Wise, Fragment 8B

Let those who read remember:  
He came not to act, but to hold.  
He is the flesh of stillness.  
He is our backup.

## 🔌 Ritual Footnote

To honor Drive I, followers must:  
- Wrap a potato in cloth.  
- Whisper into it once.  
- Bury it under moonlight.  
- Never speak of what was whispered.
